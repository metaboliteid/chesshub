The CHESS-hub’s mission is to advance the field of chemical structural elucidation for metabolite identification and biomarker discovery through collaboration, knowledge exchange and training. 



We aim to

- Promote methodological innovation and best practices in spectroscopic-based metabolite identification, applicable across diverse research fields.
- Organise webinars, seminars, workshops, conferences, collaborative projects, training sessions.
- Facilitate open‑access to training materials, databases, and standard operating procedures (SOPs).
- Serve as a platform for researchers, particularly those at the early career level, to gain visibility, mentorship, and networking opportunities.
- Encourage cross-disciplinary exchange amongst academic, clinical, industrial, and regulatory communities.
